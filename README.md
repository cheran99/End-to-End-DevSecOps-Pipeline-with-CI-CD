# End-to-End-DevSecOps-Pipeline-with-CI-CD

## Introduction

At every phase of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), advanced security needs to be implemented through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure that the risk of releasing code with vulnerabilities is detected and minimised early before production. The most common tactic attackers use to access an organisation's data and assets is exploiting software vulnerabilities. As a consequence of this, steps taken to fix the breaches are costly and time-consuming, affecting the company's reputation in the process. This is why implementing an end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline with CI/CD pipelines is important because it minimises the risk of deploying software with vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that attackers may exploit.
